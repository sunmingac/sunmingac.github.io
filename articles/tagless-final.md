## Free Monad to Tagless Final

Free Monad and Tagless Final offer different approaches to structuring and abstracting computations in a program, providing flexibility, modularity, and testability.

### Free Monads
A Free Monad is a construction in category theory used in functional programming to separate a computation's declaration from its execution. It allows developers to build complex operations as sequences of simpler operations without committing to a particular effect or implementation until the last possible moment (i.e., during the composition root of your application).

#### Structure of Free Monads
Free Monads are built around two basic constructs:

- **Free Structure**: This is essentially a recursive data structure that represents a computation step that can be chained with other steps. A Free Monad for a functor F can be defined as a data type that supports pure computation (Pure) and a wrapped functor holding a next step (Suspend).

- **Interpreters**: These are used to execute the operations defined by the Free Monad. This allows for different interpretations of the operations, making the system highly flexible and adaptable. You can have multiple interpreters for the same abstract operations, each implementing a different aspect of behavior (e.g., testing, logging, or different side effects).



### Tagless Final
Tagless Final is an alternative approach to abstracting over effectful computations in functional programming. Rather than constructing a monad explicitly (like in Free Monads), Tagless Final uses a higher-kinded type (a type constructor that takes another type constructor) to abstract over the effect type.

#### Structure of Tagless Final
Tagless Final typically involves:

- **Type Classes**: Define generic operations as part of a type class. These operations are abstract and do not specify details about the effects they use.

- **Implementations**: Concrete implementations of these type classes specify how the effects are handled. For example, you might implement a type class in a way that performs IO, another in-memory for tests, etc.


### Compariasion
Free Monads might introduce complexity in terms of understanding and maintaining the intermediate data structures. It provides a lot of flexibility at the cost of performance due to the need to interpret an intermediate data structure. 

Tagless Final's complexity often lies in understanding higher-kinded types and abstract type members. This approache tend to have better performance and simpler constructs.
